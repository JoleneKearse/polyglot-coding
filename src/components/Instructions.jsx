      <p>I impulse bought this utterly fantastic course <a href="https://codewithmosh.com/p/python-projects-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python Projects for Beginners by CodeWithMosh</a> that strengthens your problem-solving skills.</p>
      <p>It gave me a chance to discover new features of <b className="language">Python</b> and skill up.</p>
      <p>I also wanted to become more comfortable in <b className="language">C#</b>, so I re-wrote many of the projects in it.</p>
      <p>I decided to also write them in <b className="language">JavaScript</b> to demystify them.</p>
      <p>Each project let's you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get a sense of the MVP.</li>
        <li>Play around with the <b className="language">JavaScript</b> implementation.</li>
        <li>Compare the code in all languages.</li>
      </ul>
